Hi! My name is Mahak!

This paper explores the participation in elections with  consumption of social media, feelings toward national symbols and social experiences such as trust, perceived likelihood of society and experience with discrimination.


The data is taken from General Social Survey (GSS), Cycle 27, 2013 (version 2): Social Identity, through CHASS website, accessible over 25 different universities.  The raw data is saved in inputs/data/AAEV5tkb.txt. The codebook.txt and Stata.txt files help clean the raw data.

The cleaned data will be saved in inputs/data/ and the script for the code will be saved to scripts. After this, outputs/paper/paper.Rmd will include information about the paper and the outputs/paper/paper.pdf will be uploaded on quercus.
